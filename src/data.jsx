But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls.",

Covering an area of 25 sq km at a height of 7,238 ft, Shimla is surrounded by pine, deodar and oak forests.

        description:"Mussoorie, also known as Queen of the Hills, is among the most popular hill stations of the country. A Britisher, Captain Frederick Young, accompanied by an official named FJ Shore, had climbed up the hill from the Doon valley in 1827 and found this ridge offering great views and a salubrious climate. This visit laid the foundation for this grand hill station. A captivating paradise for leisure travellers and honeymooners, it is a perfect summer resort. Located on a 15-km-long horseshoe ridge with the grand Himalayas as a backdrop, Mussoorie spreads across at a height of 2,000 m above sea level. From this vantage point, it offers scenic views of Himalayas peaks in Western Garhwal.",
